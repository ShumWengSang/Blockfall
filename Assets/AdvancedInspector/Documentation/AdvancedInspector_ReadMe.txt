=== Advanced Inspector ===
by LightStriker Software

The Inspector, or in other engine the "property grid", is one of the most important tool we have to use. 
It's the window to all our data, and if this tool is lacking, everything we do and how fast we do it, will also suffer from it.

There's lot of Inspector package in the Asset Store, but none that we feel give us the "full package". 
To solve this issue, we've been working on this package for over seven months. One of the first thing we found out is, 
the classes behind the Inspector - SerializedProperty, SerializedObject - were also too limited for our needs, 
surprisingly restrained to a single serialization context. We rewrote them from scratch.

In this package, everything how the Inspector draw and handle data have been reworked from the ground up. 
"Advanced Inspector" is what we believe Unity's Inspector should have been from the start.

Our DLL also comes with a fully commented .xml so our comments shows up in your code editor.
Please read the AdvancedInspector_Manual.pdf for more information about the inner working of each parts.

== FAQ ==

- Why a DLL?

It's easier to distribute, but mostly there's some internal code that are not fully debugged outside the scope of the Advanced Inspector. 
For example, we have a TreeView that is not completed, but for the AI - listing non-nested items - it works.

- Can I get access to the source?

Contact us, maybe we can deal something, but no promises.
The package, as is, should perform any task you want it to perform without the need to the source.
The Advanced Inspector is fully expandable.

- Mac? Linux?

We didn't test this on Linux, but we did on Mac. 

- I found a bug!

Contact us right away! We will fix it ASAP.

- I got idea for other features...

Again, contact us! We will look into adding that feature - if humanly possible - as quickly as we can.

- I don't understand how it works, how to use it or how to implement it!

Contact us, we will gladly help you.


== Version ==

1.0:
- Release

1.1:
- Fixed the Camera preview (the window can be dragged around)
- Fixed the Camera perspective/orthographic drop down with new RestrictedAttribute option.
- Added SkinnedMeshRenderer and Text Mesh as converted editor.
- Added a way to decouple data from description in the RestrictedAttribute. Just pass DescriptorPair instead of the object directly.
- Added a missing constructor in ReadOnlyAttribute.
- Changed the constraint field in the RigidBody because "I prefer the checkboxes".
- Non-editable expandable field - such as object deriving from System.Object - now display info in the format "ToString() [Class Name]". Overriding ToString becomes useful. 
- Fixed a null error in the Restricted > Toolbox.
- SizeAttribute can now flag a collection as not-sortable. Useful for collection which the order comes from the code and should not be changed.
- Added a new Attribute; RuntimeResolve which display a field editor based on the object's type or a type returned by a delegate, instead of the field type. 
It can also be used to restrict a Object field to a specific type. For example, you can make a UnityEngine.Object field only display Material.
- Added a new Attribute; CollectionConstructor which let you create a collection item with the constructor and parameter of your choice.
- Moved the asset into Plugins and Plugins/Editor folder, so other language - like JS - can be supported without modification.
- Copied the Examples asset into JavaScript, also used to test other language support.
- Added a class named "ActionBinding" which is a way to bind an event to a data-driven method invokation. Similar to what Unity will roll out in 4.6 with their new GUI... but better.
Take a look at the video for more information. It's an example of what the AI can do, as no editor were writing for that class.

1.2:
- Fixed an issue with Editor object showing the log message about no reference towards them when saving a scene. It was harmless, but annoying.
- Fixed an issue with internal texture showing the same log message.
- Fixed a index exception while deleting an item in some specific cases. It was harmless, but annoying.
- Fixed the multi-edition on boolean editor.
- Update some internal icon; +, -, open, closed and the drag icon. They should be easier to see in both light and dark.
- Added IPreview interface that gives control over the preview panel of the inspector. New class in the DLL; InspectorPreview.
- Added a new attribute; "Tab". Draws toolbar-like tabs at the top of a script, similar to the SkinnedCloth component.
- Added the standard "on scene" collider editor on the Box, Capsule, and Sphere collider.
- Added a class named TypeUtility. It is used only to retrieve a type in all loaded assembly based on its name.
- Added SkinnedMeshRenderer, TextMesh and Mesh editor.
- Added "very large array" support. Any collection having over 50 items only displays 50, and have arrows at the top and bottom to navigate in them.
- Added UDictionary, a fully Unity-serializable dictionary for Unity 4.5 and later. Does not work on previous Unity version.
- Added RangeInt/RangeFloat, struct used to set a minimum and a maximum. They use Unity's MinMaxSlider.
- The Space attribute can now add space before an item and/or after it. Before default size is 0, after default size is 1. Does not change existing behaviour.

1.3:
- IMPORTANT: All classes related to the Advanced Inspector have been moved to the AdvancedInspector namespace, for consistency with other assemblies (Ex.: System.Serializable) and not to pollute the global scope.
- The AdvancedInspector Attribute now have "InspectDefaultItem" property, which emulate the way Unity display items without the need to add [Inspect] on all your items. You can still inspect item Unity would not display by adding the Inspect Attribute.
- Help Attribute can now be tagged on a class, giving a help box in the header or footer. You can also place multiple instance of the Help attributes, which displays multiple help box.
- Help Attribute now has the "Position" property, which place the help box before or after the targeted member, or in case of a class, in the header or footer.
- Expandable Attribute now has the "Expanded" property, which forces an item to be expanded by default when first viewed.
- Group Attribute now has the "Expandable"  property, which when false, the group is not collapsable and remains open, serving has a dividing box.
- Added a layout "header" and "footer" at the top and bottom of the inspector, before and after all the fields.
- Added an interface; IInspectorRunning, which gives access to the Header and Footer zone in the form of a OnHeaderGUI and OnFooterGUI method.
- InspectorField now support SerializableProperties, but please do not use it, it's most likely full of bug since SerializedProperty is anything but generic.
- CTRL + Click expand all the child of the item expanded. (Ex.: All the subobject in a list)
- Removed the "[class name]" part of the label of a list when that item is the same type as the list itself. (Ex.: List<item>, no need to tell you it's an item)
- The collection type is now only display in Advanced or Debug mode.
- Removed the "shadows" from the following icon; add, delete, folder open, folder close.
- Fixed a null exception thrown when using enums in a Dictionary.
- Added cubemap to the supported type in the Preview.
- Reworked the layout a lot, such as adding 4 pixel to the left of the fields so they don't stick to the window. Now nested item are "boxed-in", which should make multi-level items easier to read.
- Lined up lot of items and subitem that were not properly lined up in specific case in both their label and fields.
- Fixed the Example6 where nested class where not serialized.
- Added methods "GetAttributes" and "GetAttributes<T>" to the Inspector field, returning all instance of a multi-attributes.
- Fixed the aspect ratio in the Camera preview on Scene.
- SkinnedMeshRender "Bones" property is no longer "read only", but it is now an advanced property.

- Descriptor with only a color no longer pass on an empty name to the label.
- Added a missing constructor in AdvancedInspector attribute.
- Expandable attribute now has the InspectDefaultItems similar to the AdvancedInspector attribute.

1.69:
[CHANGES]

[FIXES]

- Property drawers bound by attributes were not being recongnized anymore. Fixed!
- Changed how Apply/Revert works with prefabs, since the data was reverted, but not the link to the prefabs. Some issues still need to be resolved.
- DescriptorAttribute applied directly to Enum can now target a static method delegate.
- Apply "SetDirty" when a Method attribute has a undo message so that Prefabs can be considered modified.
- Namespaced some classes that weren't previously.
