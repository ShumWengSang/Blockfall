Levels
					Done. Don't care anymore about this.

Programming

	Powerups			!!!(Of all the powerups, only the solution and move a block makes sense to 					implement.)!!!
		Undo 			(90% done, Portal and special effect blocks seems to have problems. Again, does 						this even make sense?)
		Solution 		(80%) (Can read and replay answers. Need someone to make the answers all over 							again. After that need to test against portals and vortex, but expected to work 						properly)(Portals do not yet work properly)
		Hint 			(50%) (Halted. Not sure if this is feasible at all.)
		Move a Block 		(0%)
	Pause Widget 			(95% done)
		Sound On/Off 		(100% done) (Awaiting sound assets)
		Speed Multiplier Slider (100% done) (Awaiting sound assets)
		Music On/Off 		(100% done)
		Level Select 		(100% done)
		Skip Level 		(100% done)
		Continue 		(100% done)
	Sound 				(0%) (Require Assets)
	Unity Service 			(0%) 
	Facebook integration. 		(0%) 
	Admob				(0%) 

UI
	Level Selection
		Redo the sliding moving things using DOTWeen Sequence to make it more responsive as well as generally 		better.
	
Assets	Sounds
	Moving Background(?)

Bugs
	Can swipe and turn while in paused mode. ( MAJOR BUG)
	If MasterGameScene starts with blocks already inside, and loaded from LevelSelection, error will occur and loading of blocks will stop. (Workaround, make sure MasterGameScene no blocks inside using Create New Puzzle).
	Blocks not aligned when falling in ANDROID. (Not sure on PC)
