Programming

	Powerups			!!!(Of all the powerups, only the solution and move a block makes sense to 					implement.)!!!
		Undo 			(90% done, Portal and special effect blocks seems to have problems. Again, does 						this even make sense?)
		Solution 		(80%) (Can read and replay answers. Need someone to make the answers all over 							again. After that need to test against portals and vortex, but expected to work 						properly)(Portals do not yet work properly)
		Hint 			(50%) (Halted. Not sure if this is feasible at all.)
		Move a Block 		(0%)

FEEDBACK:
	Back Button on android should be native.
	UI needs improvement. Sliding UI no good.
	Controls need improvement. Need it to be more intuitive. Some sort of UI help to show players.
